TL,DR: I'm keeping a log of all arch related problems

I had already attempted something of this sort, more or less 1 year ago.
This initial log goes on for about 40 days, from 2013-10-05 to 2013-11-15.
During this time period the following problems were logged:

- 2013-10-05 `slim` changed xsession
- 2013-10-14 `kernel-ck` update broke xorg, downgrading to previous kernel fixed it
- 2013-10-29 `xmobar` not working, template in ~/.xmobarrc had to be fixed
- 2013-11-02 `calibre` not working, found out that imagemagik is broken? Fixed by pkg upgrade/downgrade

Today of the pkgs listed above I only still use `calibre` occasionaly.
Given that `kernel-ck` is not the official kernel and that `slim` was/is a
terrible fit with systemd the new log should be less populated.
