After 3 weeks of not updating I ran `pacman -Syu`.

About 850 MB of updates had to be downloaded and installed. Everything seems to be working
fine at the moment. I only had to update the `/etc/group` file since some new groups were added
by the filesystem pkg maintainers and I also had to check if the update mirrors still existed in the
new `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`.
